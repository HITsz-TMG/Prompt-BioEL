</p>

An entity re-ranking model based on **prompt tuning** for **biomedical entity linking**,
along with a KB-enhanced self-supervised pretraining strategy.
More details can be found in our paper
"Improving Biomedical Entity Linking with Cross-Entity Interaction" (accepted by [AAAI 2023](https://aaai-23.aaai.org/)).
