For **biomedical entity linking (EL)**,
we aim at modeling **fine-grained comparison among candidate entities**,
and propose a re-ranking model based on **prompt tuning**,
along with a KB-enhanced self-supervised pretraining strategy.
Our method achieves **state-of-the-art results** across 3 biomedical EL datasets (NCBI disease, BC5CDR and COMETA).
